    Create a view into the array with the given shape and strides.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    x : ndarray
        A new ndarray
    shape : sequence of int, optional
        The shape of the new tensor(conver to narray at begining). Defaults to ``x.shape``.
    strides : sequence of int, optional
        The strides of the new tensor(conver to narray at begining). Defaults to ``x.strides``.
    subok : bool, optional

        If True, subclasses are preserved.
    writeable : bool, optional
        .. versionadded:: 1.12
        If set to False, the returned array will always be readonly.
        Otherwise it will be writable if the original array was. It
        is advisable to set this to False if possible (see Notes).
    Returns
    -------
    view : ndarray
    See also
    --------
    broadcast_to: broadcast an array to a given shape.
    reshape : reshape an array.
    Notes
    -----
    ``as_strided`` creates a view into the tensor given the exact strides
    and shape. At the begining of as_strided funciton. I use session.run() 
    function to convert the tensor to the numpy arrays.Then we can do some
    operations on such arrays. 
    It is advisable to always use the original ``x.strides`` when
    calculating new strides to avoid reliance on a contiguous memory
    layout.
    Vectorized write operations on such arrays will typically be unpredictable.
    They may even give different results for small, large, or transposed arrays. 
    Furthermore, arrays created with this function often contain self
    overlapping memory, so that two elements are identical.
    Since writing to these arrays has to be tested and done with great
    care, you may want to use ``writeable=False`` to avoid accidental write
    operations.
    For these reasons it is advisable to avoid ``as_strided`` when
    possible.
