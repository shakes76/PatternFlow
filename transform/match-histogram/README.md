# Histogram matching

Rewrite match_histograms function from skimage.exposure module in Tensorflow.

Author: Yao Chen

## Description
Histogram matching is a process where a time series, image, or higher dimension scalar data is modified such that its histogram matches that of another (reference) dataset. A common application of this is to match the images from two sensors with slightly different responses, or from a sensor whose response changes over time. In this function,
adjust an image so that its cumulative histogram matches that of another.
The adjustment is applied separately for each channel.

## How it works
For two given images, reference image and target image. The match_cumulative_cdf function will calculate the cumulative distribution and probability distribution of reference image. Devide two images into many bins. Use interpolation funtion to match two images by their corresponding bins. Use ths probability distribution of reference to redraw the target image.

The algorithm is as follows. The cumulative histogram is computed for each dataset, see the diagram below. For any particular value (xi) in the data to be adjusted has a cumulative histogram value given by G(xi). This in turn is the cumulative distribution value in the reference dataset, namely H(xj). The input data value xi is replaced by xj.

## Example 
This example demonstrates the feature of histogram matching. It manipulates the pixels of an input image so that its histogram matches the histogram of the reference image. If the images have multiple channels, the matching is done independently for each channel, as long as the number of channels is equal in the input image and the reference.

```python
image = tf.convert_to_tensor(data.chelsea())
reference = tf.convert_to_tensor(data.coffee())
matched = mh.match_histograms(image, reference, multichannel=True)
fig, (ax1, ax2, ax3) = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=3, figsize=(8, 3),
                                    sharex=True, sharey=True)
for aa in (ax1, ax2, ax3):
        aa.set_axis_off()
ax1.imshow(image1)
ax1.set_title('Source')
ax2.imshow(image2)
ax2.set_title('Reference')
ax3.imshow(matched)
ax3.set_title('Matched')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
