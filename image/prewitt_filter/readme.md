# Prewitt Operator


 Tensorflow implementation of the prewitt operator and accompanying short demonstration.

 The prewitt operator performs gradient approximation through a combination of convolutional filters. The gradient approximation of both horizontal and vertical components is used to approximate the gradient of the image intensity. The resultant approximation serves as a simple edge detection algorithm. 

## Usage
Image must be a 2-Dimensional single channel grayscale image.

>Input:  2D Float32 Tensor  
>Output: 2D Float32 Tensor.

``` 
prewitt_filter(image)
```
 
 >image :: 2D Tensor [width,height] <float32\> representing the grayscale image to apply the filter to.


## Output
