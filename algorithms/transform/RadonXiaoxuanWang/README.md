# Radon Transform by Xiaoxuan Wang
## implemented using TensorFlow

Student Number: 45448274

## Warning
Compared to its original version in skimage module, this tensorflow version is quite slow. In the driver script, the radon transform module takes about 2 minutes on a regular Mac computer.

## Description of the Algorithm
The Radon transform is an algorithm that takes an image and produces its line integrals from a specified angle.

## Usage of the module
Please run the driver script in interactive mode. The inverse radon transform module is imported from skimage to confirm the correctness of the tensorflow radon transform.
