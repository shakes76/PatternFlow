# Implementing a VQ-VAE for the OASIS dataset
VQ-VAEs are a variety of variational autoencoders (hence VAE), which take on the ideas of vector quantisation (VQ) to improve their effectiveness. 

My VQVAE model was constructed based on the implementation from Keras at: https://keras.io/examples/generative/vq_vae/

The OASIS dataset was downloaded through blackboard and preprocessing it included normalising the images. 

I did not get very conclusive results as my GPU cannot handle this many data samples and I could not finid an adequate solution.
