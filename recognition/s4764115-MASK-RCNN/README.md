# A MASK R-CNN network for lesion detection within the ISIC Dataset.
A tensorflow implimentation of MASK R-CNN model to solve report promblem 3.

## The Dataset
The ISIC 2017 dataset is used in the model for lesion detection, containing:
 - 2000 lesion images for training
 - 150 images for validation
 - 600 images for testing


## MASK R-CNN 

### What is MASK R-CNN?
MASK R-CNN is an object detection model based on deep convolutional neural netwworks (CNN) developed by a AI research group in Facebook in 2017. The model can return both the bounding box and a mask for each detected object in an image.
