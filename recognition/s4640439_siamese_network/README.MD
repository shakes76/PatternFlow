Requirements
1. The readme file should contain a title, a description of the algorithm and the problem that it solves
(approximately a paragraph), how it works in a paragraph and a figure/visualisation.
2. It should also list any dependencies required, including versions and address reproduciblility of results,
if applicable.
3. provide example inputs, outputs and plots of your algorithm
