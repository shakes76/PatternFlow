# Image Classification
This algorithm Model.ipynb is tried to classify laterality (left or right sided knee) of the OAI AKOA knee data set having a minimum accuracy
of 0.9 on the test set. 

### Introduction
This algorithm Model.ipynb is tried to classify laterality (left or right sided knee) of the OAI AKOA knee data set having a minimum accuracy
of 0.9 on the test set. 
* The structure of the model is 
       *  A 16 filters Convolutional Layers with relu as the activation function 
       *  A 32 filters Convolutional Layers with relu as the activation function 
       *  A flatten Layer
       *  A Dense layer with SoftMax function as output layer
        The diagram below is the Summary of model
