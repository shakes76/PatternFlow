## ISIC Semantic Segmentation Task
Here my goal was to use the U-Net architecture I developed on the OASIS task 
to segment the skin lesion images of the ISIC dataset. While I came close and 
was able to briefly train my network, problems with the data generator eventually 
led me to submit the OASIS task for assessment.
