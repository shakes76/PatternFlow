## My contribution to PatternFlow
Here I have attempted solutions to two recognition problems, both of which utilise a 
[UNet inspired](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.10508v1) architecture. The first involves a segmentation of the 
[OASIS](https://www.oasis-brains.org/) dataset while the second segments the 
[ISIC challenge](https://challenge2018.isic-archive.com/) dataset, both of which are publically available. 
For my assessment I would like to be marked on the OASIS task; I was unable to achieve full functionality 
on the ISIC task due to issues with a data generator. Thanks!
