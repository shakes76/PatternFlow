### Discription and explanation of Work
* This Algorithm is used to solve the probelm of clkassify left or right side of knee of the OAI AKOA knee data set. 
* At the begining of the algorithm, Data observation and image visualisation is a prerequisite for this algorithm. To do this, tensorflow and glob have to be imported. Glob is used to get the names of all files which are ending with png.
* In terms of the dataset, the data set is separated into three components which are a test set, a training set, and a validation set. The training set occupied around 60% of total data which both the test set and validation set have about 20% of training data. In this algorithm, there are two convolutional layers which are followed by a flatten layer and an output layer( Activation function: Softmax)
### Result of the Model
Finally, the accuracy of the model is over  90% (Figure 1)
