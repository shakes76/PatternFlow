# Recognition Problems
Various image analysis / pattern recognition problems solved in Tensorflow (TF)

This library is created and maintained by The University of Queensland [COMP3710](https://my.uq.edu.au/programs-courses/course.html?course_code=comp3710) students.

## Contributing
* Fork the dedicated 'topic-recognition' branch
* Create a directory for your problem and place your code into it.
* Your code should have functions in a separate module and a driver (main) script that runs it with parameters defined.
* The driver script should preferably either plot or save an image of the generated results
* Add a README.md file that describes the problem, its solution and shows a picture of it.
* You may upload a low res image (< 2 MB) into a folder called 'resources' in your problem directory for displaying on the README.md file
* You can see an example of this in the [SMILI repository](https://github.com/shakes76/smili).
* Then put in a pull request for the repository owner to approve and that's it!
