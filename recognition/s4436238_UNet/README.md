# Improved UNet on ISIC Dataset
###### Molly Parker s4436238 for COMP3710 

### Introduction to UNet

The UNet is a convolutional neural network that gets its name from its shape. The U-shaped network aims to effectively and efficiently segment images and output a segmentation map (i.e. a black and white image showing only the important boundaries from the original images). The downsampling portion of the network works to identify the key segments of the image, and the upsampling portion increases the resolution of the resulting map. See a visualisation of the UNet architecture in the image below.

### Improved UNet

This model aims to implement the Improved UNet over the ISIC 2018 dataset in order to identify the boundaries of images of skin lesions. The Improved UNet was first proposed by Isensee et. al. in 2018 for the BraTS (brain tumor segmentation) challenge (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.10508v1.pdf). Differentiating the Improved UNet from the original UNet is an element-wise sum operation performed on each block within the downsampling portion of the network.

### Parameters

I split the ISIC dataset into training, validation, and testing sets for this model at a 6:2:2 ratio. At the time of submission, I have only run the model over a portion of the images due to time limitations in reading the full dataset. Since the dataset contains images of differing dimensions, I also resized the original images to be 256x256x3, and the segmented images to be 256x256. 

Please note that in the process of completing this assignment, I ran into multiple issues. I initially attempted to use the Goliath cluster, but was running into errors connecting. I then attempted to use the lab machines through a remote desktop connection, but continually faced an error relating to tensorflow not utilising the GPU. The work I performed during these attempts, whilst incomplete, I mistakenly committed to the 'master' branch instead of the 'topic-recognition' branch, and as such, these will not be present in my commit log. Please let me know if you would like me to submit anything in relation to these incomplete attempts so as to showcase my progress throughout the past few weeks.
