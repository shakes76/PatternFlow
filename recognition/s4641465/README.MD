# MRI Super-Resolution Network on the ADNI Brain Dataset

## Background on ADNI Brain Dataset
The [ADNI Brain Dataset](http://adni.loni.usc.edu/) used to train this model can be found preprocessed on the COMP3710 blackboard
***

This model takes upscaled (approximately by 4x) images from the ADNI Brain Dataset and downscales them.
***
Using several (in this case 3) convolutional layers to create a feature map, the model then creates a 16 layer sub-pixel convolutional layer. Using pixel shuffling these 16 layers are reconstructed into one layer where each pixel in the sub-pixel layer corresponds to a pixel in a 4x4 section of the greater high-resolution output layer, creating a higher-resolution image

***
Here are the model results, high resolution images are taken from the test set and upscaled by 4x creating the low resolution image. These low res images are then input into the model which outputs the prediction.

![lowres](images/0-lowres.png)

The prediction is definitely an improvement on the low resolution image, but is clearly not as detailed as the high resolution image.

This graph shows the loss and the validation loss over the 100 epoch running time, the graph has an overall downwards trend and has a huge decrease at the 40 epoch range

## Running the model
### File structure:
- Dataset.py
  This python file handles extracting the images from the dataset folder and creating dataset objects with batching and a 10% validation set
- modules.py
  This python file handles creating the model
- train.py
  This python file handles training the model
- predict.py
  This python file takes images from the test set and upscales them.
  
### Instructions:
- Add dataset images to new folder named "datasets"
- run train.py to train the model
- run predict.py to output the first 32 test images, low res versions, and upscaled versions

# Dependencies:
- Tensorflow
- matplotlib
- numpy
