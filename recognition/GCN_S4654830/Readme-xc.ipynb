    "This project is for the Facebook Large Page-Page Network dataset. Also used the \"facebook.npz\" as the partially processed dataset where the features are in the form of 128 dim vectors.\n",

    "- Directed: No.\n",
    "- Node features: Yes.\n",
    "- Edge features: No.\n",
    "- Node labels: Yes. Binary-labeled.\n",

    "- Data prepare\n",
    "\n",
    "For the data preprocessing part, I first observed the data type and found that the data is a structure without phase diagram, and there are four classes, namely \"tvshow\", \"company, \"politician\", \"government\". So The predicted classification results are four classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the problem of data processing, I set up three functions, namely LOAD_DATA, STANDARD_ADJ, STANDARD_FEATURE, which are used to return the adjacency matrix, feature matrix and target matrix respectively. Standardize the adjacency matrix and standardize the feature matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "- GCN-Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "For the class that builds the GCN layer, I set up three functions, namely the INIT function, which is used to set variables and judge the USE_BIAS variable. The second is reset parameters, and the third is the FORWARD function. The layer structure used to output settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- GCN-model-define\n",
    "\n",
    "For the class that builds the GCN model, the main purpose is to use the previously set layers to build the GCN model. Two functions are set. The first is INIT, which is used to load the two build layers. The second is the FORWARD function, which is used to construct the model based on the adjacency matrix and the feature matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "- GCN-test-train\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of this file for test training is to reference the previously set classes and data to build the training logic. First, set the hyperparameters and the number of cycles to 200, introduce the constructed GCN model, and set the variable references used in the model. It contains two functions, test and train, which return accuracy and Loss history, and the history of the accuracy of the verification set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- GCN-test-script\n",
    "\n",
    "The main function of this file is to run the script commands of the GCN model, including the accuracy results of the training, and the visualization of the final classification results.\n",
