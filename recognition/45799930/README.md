# Segmentation of the ISIC Dataset with the Improved UNet

## Description of the Algorithm and Problem it Solves

The algorithm is based upon the improved UNet structure. This

## How the Algorithm Works

## Visualisation

## Dependencies

### Versions required:

```commandline
Tensorflow: 2.10.0
```

### Address reproducibility:

To ensure that the code is able to be run, you will need to download the datasets - training data, validation data, and testing data. Also you will need to download the truth of each of those datasets, where you should download the one in the first row which have the binary masks in PNG format. Once downloaded these folders should be moved to the recognition/45799930 directory, keeping the same names that where made when created. Therefore the directories that should have been added are

* ISIC-2017_Test_v2_Data
* ISIC-2017_Test_v2_Part1_GroundTruth
* ISIC-2017_Training_Data
* ISIC-2017_Training_Part1_GroundTruth
* ISIC-2017_Validation_Data
* ISIC-2017_Validation_Part1_GroundTruth
